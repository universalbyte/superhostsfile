Create your own "SuperHostsFile" to block ADS, SOCIAL-MEDIA / MALICIOUS / PORN / GAMBLING / Websites by downloading the following "hosts" files and merging them together from these great sources:

https://github.com/EnergizedProtection/block

https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist

https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

https://hosts-file.net/?s=Download

The files of the following link must be edited manually and requires elevated computing knowledge. This means that you have to put "0.0.0.0<SPACE>" (Unix/Linux/Mac OS's) or "127.0.0.1<SPACE>" (Windows OS's) without the quotes in front of every line !

For Example:

0.0.0.0 example.com , 0.0.0.0 www.example.com , 127.0.0.1 example.com , 127.0.0.1 www.example.com
